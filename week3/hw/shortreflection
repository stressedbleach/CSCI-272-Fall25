1. what is big-o notation?
  - runtime compared to the input
  - when input grows in size, the runtime grows in size, big-o shows the growth rate of that.

2. real life example
  - going through instagram followers. too many usernames, longer time needed to go through them all to find your friends. 
  - (yes this is a real problem, it took me a while to go through my following and get rid of bots/fake accounts)

3. Why vector and not array?
  - vectors resize and have built in commands. due to its automatic sizing, the memory management is easy. 
  - arrays are fixed. the memory management is difficult since it allocates the sizing before hand. 
  - like the menu, we added and removed menu items. if it was an array, we would not have been able to mopve or remove any of the items
  - or the student ids! what if new students were added?
